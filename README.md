# Unity Software Renderer
 A basic software renderer in Unity. Written in C#, uses monobehaviour for update functionality. Supports Gouraud shading, linear texturing, and one point light. Not optimized at all. Developed as a way of understanding the fundamentals of 3D rendering.

 Here's an example, running in 320x240 at a stunning circa 60 fps.
